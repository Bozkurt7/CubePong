How did I do it:

1- first I started by adding the turtle library to my code

2-Then I coded the login screen of the screen

3-Then I coded the map where the game is played and where the characters will stand.

4-After coding the ball's movements, I continued by coding the part where the players' scores are located.

5-I coded the movements of the characters

6-I wrote a code to prevent players from leaving the screen after I had the screen refreshed.

7-I let the ball bounce when it comes to the upper and lower barriers
                     
8- If the players cannot block the ball, I wrote the counter player to add points
